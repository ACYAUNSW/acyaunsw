        Australia-Chinese Youth Association is a not-for-profit organisation with an aim to foster a translational community of 
        young people who are interested in the Australia-China space and want to gain insight into these countries. Through our 
        social and professional events in the careers, education and people-to-people portfolio, we aim to encourage our members 
        to take initiative to develop and challenge themselves. 

        Our goal is to encourage the active involvement of students in developing cultural, social and economic awareness and to 
        build on existing knowledge through building relationships, sharing experiences and taking on new challenges.
